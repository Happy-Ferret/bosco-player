### installing stuf

dev/test/prod

dev - run in the ide
test - runs from ~/.local
prod - runs from  /usr/local

it needs to run smoothly in all locations
but the bits are in different locations and reference each other.

code references locations
.ui references icon location - not a good idea
.desktop file references locations

1st part of code:
```
#!/usr/bin/env gjs
const PREFIX = "/home/bruce/gjs/bosco/"
const PREFIX = "/home/bruce/.local/"
const PREFIX = "/usr/local/"
```
use sed to reset the prefix during install.

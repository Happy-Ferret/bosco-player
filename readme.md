### Bosco Player ###

Bosco Player should provide a gui to 
* manage component definitions (entitas.json)
* organize assets and update the resource xml - look at grrr.js
* edit .desktop file
* select icon
* start in debugger
* rebuild autovala
* rebuild code


Future?
* profile while running the game (see ts version of entitas)
* manage entity definitions
* adjust pool sizes
* scripting

### gjs - inheriting gobject
Prefer composition over inheritance.

We could use Lang.Class to proxy Gtk framework objects
I think this makes the code less clear, due to the non-standard inheritance syntax
I also don't like inheriting big framework objects, especially poorly documented ones.
You end up overriding or colliding with properties & methods, and javascipt doesn't warn you.
This leads to unexpected behavior and brittle base class.
Using composition also allows me to use my own class hierarchy scheme for my classes. 

### gjs + coffeescript + tsc

compile coffeescript to javascript, then
use tsc to ensure es5 compatible and packege up with dependencies.

The result is sort of like a webpack or browserify bundle.
Uses amd compatible module definitions.


The downside - gjs is linux only.
But I would have to do dev on windows for that to matter...

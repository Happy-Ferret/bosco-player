### Bosco Player ###

Gtk application written with TypeScript

## status
An experiment using typescript with Gtk to create a standard desktop app.

bosco displays autovala data for a project.



### build

I use vscode. ctrl-b to build, f5 to run

or 'tsc' to build from command line
### install

this doesn't use the autogen style install recomended by gnome.
it's a typescript app, and has a custom install script.

```
git clone git@github.com:darkoverlordofdata/bosco-player.git
cd bosco-player
npm install
tsc 
./install
```
